# Unsupervised:

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns patterns from unlabeled data without any explicit guidance. The goal is to discover the underlying structure or relationships within the data.

some common types of unsupervised learning algorithms, including appropriate examples:


# Clustering Algorithms:

K-means Clustering: Divides the data into a predetermined number of clusters, where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean.
Hierarchical Clustering: Builds a tree of clusters by merging or splitting clusters based on the distance between data points.
DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise): Identifies clusters based on density, forming clusters of varying shapes and sizes.
Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM): Represents the distribution of data points as a mixture of several Gaussian distributions, allowing for more flexible cluster shapes.
Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms:

Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Linear dimensionality reduction technique that projects high-dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional space while preserving the maximum variance.
t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE): Non-linear dimensionality reduction technique that emphasizes preserving the local structure of the data in the lower-dimensional space.
Autoencoders: Neural network-based approach for learning compact representations of high-dimensional data by training the network to reconstruct its input.
Anomaly Detection Algorithms:

Isolation Forest: Identifies anomalies by isolating them in randomly generated partitions of the data space.
One-Class SVM (Support Vector Machine): Learns a boundary around normal data points and identifies outliers as data points outside this boundary.
Local Outlier Factor (LOF): Determines the local density of data points and identifies outliers as points with substantially lower densities compared to their neighbors.
Association Rule Learning:


# Apriori Algorithm:
It Discovers frequent itemsets in transactional datasets and derives association rules to capture relationships between items.
FP-Growth Algorithm: Constructs a compact data structure called an FP-tree to efficiently mine frequent itemsets and generate association rules.

Apriori algorithm is an unsupervised algorithm that helps in creating association rules from a given dataset.



Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): Consists of a generator and a discriminator neural network that compete against each other. The generator generates samples, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and generated samples. GANs are used for tasks like image generation, data synthesis, and data augmentation.
